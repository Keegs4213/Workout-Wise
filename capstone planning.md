Docuemntation/Powerpoint
Define- what is the problem

It is intimidating to begin working out when you don't really know what you're doing. This app is going to help all those
The main idea with this app is that there is no one set path to achieving your fitness goals. Everyone has different goals and there are different ways to reach their goals. One plan might work better for one person and not be beneficial to another depending on effort, consistency and execution.
