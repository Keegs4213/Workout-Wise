Capstone planning


List of requirements:

1. User Authentication:

Register new users (collect necessary details like name, email, password, etc.).
Login for returning users.
Forget/Reset password functionality. 2. User Profile:

Display user information.
Allow users to edit/update their profile.
Show user's historical workout data, progress towards goals, etc. 3. Goal Setting:

Allow users to set personal fitness goals, such as weight loss/gain, strength building, improving cardio health, etc.
Enable goal tracking and progress visualization. 4. Workout Plans:

Generate personalized workout plans based on the user's goals.
Allow users to customize their workout plans (change exercises, duration, etc.).
Provide different categories/types of workouts like Cardio, Strength, Yoga, etc. 5. Exercise Library: - workout split recommended depending on goals

A comprehensive database of exercises with descriptions and instructions (preferably with pictures or videos).
Allow users to search for specific exercises based on type, muscle group, equipment, etc. 6. Nutrition tracking: - water, weight tracking?

Allow users to share their progress, workouts, and meals with friends or the public.
Provide a platform for users to ask questions, share tips, and get advice. 9. Notifications/Reminders: - some sort of encouragement , ticking off goals / workouts

Send notifications to users for workout reminders, goal progress, etc.
Implement daily/weekly reminders to log nutrition and workouts. 10. Integration with other devices:

Sync data with wearable devices like smartwatches for better activity tracking.
Integrate with other health apps (like Google Fit or Apple Health) to import/export data.
These features provide a robust framework for a comprehensive workout companion app. You can choose to implement all of them or pick and choose based on your project scope and time constraints. Additionally, prioritize features based on user needs and business value. Remember, it's important to plan thoroughly before diving into development, and to take time for proper testing and refinements after initial implementations.

Docuemntation/Powerpoint
Define- what is the problem

It is intimidating to begin working out when you don't really know what you're doing. This app is going to help all those
The main idea with this app is that there is no one set path to achieving your fitness goals. Everyone has different goals and there are different ways to reach their goals. One plan might work better for one person and not be beneficial to another depending on effort, consistency and execution.

login - reset password?
graphs for tracking = see progress
store goal and fitness level in backend not local storage 
notifcations of encouragement
library - add exercises to plan?
move API key to custom environment



to do:
<<<<<<< HEAD

library - fetches 10 exercises not 8 - fit better on page

=======
>>>>>>> development
Profile - display user goal - save changes with button 
change profile picture 
add height + weight input
fix layout

<<<<<<< HEAD
workout tracker - make 5 exercises one workout
=======
>>>>>>> development

Mobile response

To do after coding:
Design powerpoint presentation
Documentation - better google docs or github markup?

tidy code


stuff used;
bcrypt password hashing
youtube API fetch
exercise API
multer 

in future:
nutrition stuff if time + mobile response
connect to smart watches
interaction with other users - competitons, see users activty in feed, badges /achievements
