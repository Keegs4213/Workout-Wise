# Capstone Project: WorkoutWise

## Introduction
### Purpose
The aim of this project is to investigate the potential of developing a comprehensive workout companion application that offers personalized workout and nutrition plans. This app, named WorkoutWise, aims to address the need for an intuitive, full-featured workout planning and tracking tool that also offers social interaction.

This problem is valuable to address as there is a growing trend towards fitness and wellness. Currently, users often have to rely on multiple apps to track workouts, monitor nutrition, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals. The desired state is to provide all of these services in one cohesive application.

While similar projects exist, none have been found that offer the same level of personalization and social interaction that WorkoutWise plans to provide.

### Industry/ Domain
The project falls within the fitness and technology industry. Despite challenges from an increasingly competitive market, the fitness tech industry continues to grow and evolve. The overall value-chain involves fitness enthusiasts, personal trainers, nutritionists, and software developers. This project could also find relevance in other industries that require personal goal tracking and community features, such as education or mental health.

### Stakeholders
The stakeholders for this project include:

- End-users: Fitness enthusiasts who require a comprehensive tool for workout planning and tracking.
- Personal Trainers/Nutritionists: Can use the app as a platform to reach a broader audience.
- Developers: Responsible for the development and maintenance of the app.

These stakeholders care about this software because it provides a comprehensive, user-friendly tool for fitness tracking, personal goal management, and social interaction within a single platform.
