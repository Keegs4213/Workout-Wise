Purpose
The project, WorkoutWise, aims to solve the problem of personalized workout planning for individuals with varying fitness goals and levels. The opportunity lies in providing users with a solution that is tailored to their specific needs, something that generic workout plans often fail to deliver. Currently, individuals must sift through a multitude of generic plans or hire a personal trainer to get a personalized plan. The desired state is to have an easily accessible, personalized workout plan at the user's fingertips.

This problem has been addressed by other projects, but often these solutions lack the level of personalization offered by WorkoutWise or require a subscription.

Industry/ domain
The domain of this project is Health and Fitness, specifically online fitness training. The current state of the industry is dynamic with challenges from startups and an increasing shift towards online fitness due to global circumstances. The project is also relevant to the wellness and digital health industries.

Stakeholders
The stakeholders are individuals interested in fitness, specifically those seeking personalized workout plans. This includes fitness beginners, intermediates, and experts. The software is also relevant to health and wellness organizations interested in providing personalized workout plans to their clients. Stakeholders expect an easy-to-use, efficient, and effective solution for workout planning.
