## Purpose
The project, WorkoutWise, aims to solve the problem of personalized workout planning for individuals with varying fitness goals and levels. The opportunity lies in providing users with a solution that is tailored to their specific needs, something that generic workout plans often fail to deliver. Currently, individuals must sift through a multitude of generic plans or hire a personal trainer to get a personalized plan. The desired state is to have an easily accessible, personalized workout plan at the user's fingertips.

This problem has been addressed by other projects, but often these solutions lack the level of personalization offered by WorkoutWise or require a subscription.

## Industry/ domain
The domain of this project is Health and Fitness, specifically online fitness training. The current state of the industry is dynamic with challenges from startups and an increasing shift towards online fitness due to global circumstances. The project is also relevant to the wellness and digital health industries.

## Stakeholders
The stakeholders are individuals interested in fitness, specifically those seeking personalized workout plans. This includes fitness beginners, intermediates, and experts. The software is also relevant to health and wellness organizations interested in providing personalized workout plans to their clients. Potentially healthcare professionals helping clients to lose weight or personal trainers looking for inspiration for exercises to show their clients. Stakeholders expect an easy-to-use, efficient, and effective solution for workout planning.

## Open Questions/Out of Scope
Features considered out of scope include nutrition tracking and social networking capabilities. Also integration of smart watches to display more data by using the respective SDK.

**Non-functional Requirements**
Security: User login, secure storage of personal details, and data encryption. I have achieved this using bcrypt to hash and store sensitive user information in my database.
The application should be able to handle multiple user requests simultaneously.
The application should be easy to use with a user-friendly interface.
The application should respond quickly to user requests.
The application should have a high degree of reliability.

```

**Testing Strategy**
Steps taken to achieve product quality included frequent testing during the development process, I was constantly testing throughout the whole process making sure no unexpected errors occured when changing parts of my application. Using different details, routes, actions etc all to ensure everything was working as expected.
Edge cases were handled by anticipating user errors and providing appropriate error messages, leading to more efficient debugging.

**Implementation**
I had to consider whether this was to a mobile only app or a desktop + mobile application and I started with mobile only design but decided to do both to make it more accessible, I have deployed with Vercel but obviously in future I would have to get a domain and use a service like AWS to get to a production level

**End-to-end solution**
The software effectively meets its objectives by providing users with personalized workout plans based on their fitness goals and levels and a way to track their workouts.
